Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!

I'm a London-based **Neuroscientist** and **Research Software Engineer**,
currently focusing on developing free Open Source tools for studying brains
and the behaviours they produce.
I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science.
You'll often find me dancing to jazz music
and failing to play woodwind instruments.
