Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!

I'm a London-based **neuroscientist** and **research software engineer**
dedicated to developing free, open-source tools for studying brains and the
behaviours they produce.

I lead the development of [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev)
â€” a Python package for analysing animal body movements across space and time.
As a self-proclaimed **brain cartographer**, I also harbour a passion for neuroanatomy
and contribute to the [BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info/) project.

I'm deeply committed to promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible
science. I find joy in dancing to jazz and folk music.
