Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!

I'm a London-based **Neuroscientist, Research Software Engineer, and Dancer**,
currently focusing on developing free Open Source tools for studying
brains and behaviour.
I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science.
When not at the computer, you will find me dancing to jazz music
and failing to play woodwind instruments.
