Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!

I'm a London-based **neuroscientist** and **research software engineer** passionate about open, collaborative, and reproducible science.

I build open-source tools to study brains and the behaviours they produce, and I lead [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev)â€”a Python package for analysing animal motion. With a background in medicine and a PhD in neuroimaging, I've kept a long-standing interest in computational neuroanatomy, contributing to [BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info/) and helping create new brain atlases for emerging model organisms.

As a [Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme), I work to spread the adoption of open-source tools for animal behaviour, especially through training workshops for early-career researchers.

Beyond work, I find joy in dancing to jazz and folk music.
