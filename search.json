My background in medicine and a PhD in neuroimaging have left me with a passion for neuroanatomy, and especially brain atlases.\nI am deeply committed to promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science. I find joy in dancing to jazz music and in failing to play woodwind instruments.\n\nCurrent Role\nSenior Research Software Engineer\n\nNeuroinformatics Unit\nSainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour\nGatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit\nUniversity College London"
