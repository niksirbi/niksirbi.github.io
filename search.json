    "text": "Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!\nI’m a London-based neuroscientist and research software engineer passionate about open, collaborative, and reproducible science.\nI build open-source tools to study brains and the behaviours they produce, and I lead movement—a Python package for analysing animal motion. With a background in medicine and a PhD in neuroimaging, I’ve kept a long-standing interest in computational neuroanatomy, contributing to BrainGlobe and helping create new brain atlases for emerging model organisms.\nAs a Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, I work to spread the adoption of open-source tools for animal behaviour, especially through training workshops for early-career researchers.\nBeyond work, I find joy in dancing to jazz and folk music.\n\nCurrent Role\nSenior Research Software Engineer\n\nNeuroinformatics Unit\nSainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour\nGatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit\nUniversity College London"
