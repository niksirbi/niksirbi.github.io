With a background in medicine and a PhD in neuroimaging, I’ve kept a long-standing interest in computational neuroanatomy, contributing to BrainGlobe and helping create new brain atlases for emerging model organisms.\nAs a Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, I work to spread the adoption of open-source tools for animal behaviour, especially through training workshops for early-career researchers.\nBeyond work, I find joy in dancing to jazz and folk music.\n\nCurrent Role\nSenior Research Software Engineer\n\nNeuroinformatics Unit\nSainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour\nGatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit\nUniversity College London"
